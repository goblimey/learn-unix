Split L0.1a into two so each fits in a normal 24x80 xterm.
Removed @ and #, replacing with geneirc ERASE and KILL.

updated software: fixed missing mkdtemp();  clear playpen at the start
of each lesson (results analysis used to break occasionally because of
files left over from previous lessons).

Updated preambles to files and morefiles - original said they were out of
date.

Changed "print" to "display" where necessary throughout files and morefiles
lessons - original material used print for display because written in the
days of teletypes!

Removed all use of backspace and underline for emphasis in files and
morefiles.  Doesn't work nowadays.

Rewrote all examples in files and morefiles which used "named for" instead
of "named after".  Colloquialism confuses readers not familiar with american
usage.

files: L0.1a Removed first line from L0.1a (read "$ more L0.1a", suspect it
got corrupted somewhere).  Updated to suggest "stty -a" instead of "stty".
Reformatted and clarified the text.

morefiles: L0.1b said that total in ls listing was amount of space used
by files.  Changed to "number of files".

morefiles: L0.1f didn't create any files.  Doesn't work now that playpen
cleared after each lesson.  Now creates files.

morefiles: L3.1a split into two file L3.1a and L3.1aa.  The first explains
the use of "more" which is now needed for some of the exercises.  (Results
are too big for the screen.)

morefiles: L1.1c changed backspace to tab.  Would cause problems if
the  character delete sequence was set to backspace.  (Tab would cause
problems if learn used the bash shell, but it uses /bin/sh.)

morefiles: L6.1a clarified question - want to combine the files and
get the last fifteen lines, NOT take the last 15 lines of each and
combine.
