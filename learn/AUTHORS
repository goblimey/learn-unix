Mike Lesk of AT&T Bell Laboratories wrote the original version and
the lessons.  It was distributed as part of version 7 UNIX, the 1978
vintage.

The OpenBSD team (www.openBSD.org) reworked the software for that
version of UNIX.

The software then languished in the OpenBSD archive for several years.
in that time, the C language evolved and it became impossible to build
the software using up to date tools.

Various versions of UNIX appeared which did not include the learn
software.  In 1991 Finnish student Linus Torvalds released Linux, a
free and open source version of the UNIX kernel.  This, combined with
the already available GNU tools produced GNU Linux, a free version of
UNIX.  Linux became extremely popular and is a key component of cloud
computing.  By default, Linux does not include the learn software.

In 2002, Simon Ritchie fixed the software so it would build and run,
bought it under the control of the GNU build tools so that it could be
installed on Linux and other UNIX systems.  He also updated the
lessons in the "files" and "morefiles" courses.  In 2019 he reworked
the build process so that learn could be built and run by docker.
